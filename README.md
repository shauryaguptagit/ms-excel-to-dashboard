# Interactive Payment Dashboard

This repository contains an interactive dashboard built with Streamlit, developed during my data management internship at Pragyawan Technologies Pvt. Ltd. (Jul-Sept 2025).

## 🎯 Purpose

This tool was designed to solve a key business problem: decision-makers needed a faster, more intuitive way to analyze payment data, which was traditionally stored in complex Excel spreadsheets.

## ✨ Features

* **Interactive Visualization:** Uses **Streamlit** to create dynamic charts and tables from company payment data.
* **Data Analysis:** Leverages the **Pandas** library to read, process, and aggregate the data efficiently.
* **Faster Insights:** Enables the team to filter data, spot trends, and make quicker decisions without needing manual Excel analysis.

## 💻 Technology Stack

* **Python**
* **Streamlit** (for the interactive web app)
* **Pandas** (for data manipulation)

**Note on Data:** The original proprietary company data has been removed. This repository uses a sample file (`sample_payments.csv`) with dummy data to demonstrate the dashboard's functionality.
